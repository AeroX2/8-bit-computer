# Notice (mostly for me)
This is the old repo just for the Logisim version, if you are looking for the TinyTapeout version it is here

# 8-Bit Computer
An 8-bit computer designed in Logisim.

Currently supports
- mov between registers a,c and d
- cmp
- jmp
- condition jmps (=,!=,<,<=,>,>=)
- alu operations
- load from rom and ram
- save from register to ram
- read from the in port
- output to out port

# Roadmap
- [x] Create an assembler
- [x] Get a simple program working (Fibonacci 8bit)
- [x] Get a simple program working (Prime generation 8bit)
- [x] Get a relatively complex program working (Fibonacci 8digit)
- [ ] Get a relatively complex program working (Prime generation 8digit)
- [ ] Test on real hardware (FPGA/CPLD)
- [ ] Create a new language for the computer
- [ ] Create a compiler for that language
- [ ] Transpiler for C/C++
- [ ] Tetris
